          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl text-white font-semibold mt-6">1. Rental Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            Customers must be at least 21 years old and possess a valid driverâ€™s license with at least 1 year of driving experience. Additional ID proof may be required at pickup.

          <p>
            All bookings must be confirmed with valid payment details. We accept major debit and credit cards. Full payment is required before vehicle handover.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl text-white font-semibold mt-6">3. Cancellation & Refund</h2>

          <p>
            The rented vehicle must only be driven by the person(s) listed in the rental agreement. Any illegal or negligent use will result in penalties and possible legal action.
